# DL-Approach-for-Optimal-Stopping

*The model of DNN to fit function $g_\theta(t,x)$ in Pytorch\
The Loss function is defined by the negative reward function $C_\theta(t,x)$ in paper\
The training data is sampled from the Monta Carlo method  as the paper shows\
Config is the class covering the parameters and hyperparameters*
